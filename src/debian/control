Description: A pure Netfilter Firewall configured for Linux
 A firewall that uses nft only, is easily configured through Ansible, has some 
 sane defaults for security, doesn't restrict the full flexibility of other
 pure netfilter firewall configuration, uses common or simple tools and
 formats, and integrates nicely with existing networking architecture.
