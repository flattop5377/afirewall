afirewall (20240921.0.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Flattop ]
  * Added a command line parameter for a configuration file, and a test for
    that configuration file.  Changed the python script to use os.access to
    test that the file is readable.  Closes: #2
  * Changed the name of the python script from afirewall to afirewall.py so
    it is a valid python module.  Package maintainers are adding in a symbolic
    link so command-line usage remains afirewall.
