Description: Pure Netfilter Firewall configured for Linux
 Pure firewall that uses nft only, is easily configured through
 Ansible, has some sane defaults for security, doesn't restrict
 the full flexibility of other pure netfilter firewall
 configuration, uses common or simple tools and formats, and
 integrates nicely with existing networking architecture.
