Description: A pure Netfilter Firewall configured for Linux
 A firewall that uses nft only, is easily configured through Ansible, has some sane defaults for security, doesn't restrict the full flexibility of other pure netfilter firewall configuration, uses common or simple tools and formats, and integrates nicely with existing networking architecture.
